Proximity Button Sets: this allows you to gracefully
handle inaccurate finger-placement on touchscreen
boolean buttons.

The demo scene will give you a simple use case.

This demo has been tested on Unity 4.6.1 but probably
works on most recent flavors of Unity. Try it out!!

Also adding in my MicroTouch and VAButton classes. Enjoy!

Also adding in a TextLayer class for text-mode rendering.
